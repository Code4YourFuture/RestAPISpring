Learn how to make a REST API using Spring MVC!

Out of the box, Spring and its modules can allow us to create fully functional REST APIs!
We go over the basics of using JPA and Entity, as well as creating controllers and repositories
to handle information. 

The JPA can do more than just CRUD functions, so I go over how to easily do search functionality
or even filtering things in a range. There is so much more you can learn outside the video. 
Eventually, you will want to combine your knowledge of how to make an API, with other modules
from Spring like Security, so that you can make the next killer app!
